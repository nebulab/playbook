# Meetings

Communicating via Slack is our bread and butter, but sometimes a synchronous meeting is needed.
Throughout the years we have built some best practices that help us make our meetings as effective
as possible.

## Organization of the meeting

- **Don't be afraid to say no.** We are all afraid of missing out on important things. However, if
  you are invited to a meeting but you think that there is no reason for you to be there, don't be
  afraid to ask what contribution you could make or what benefit you could get from it. If nobody
  can answer you, your presence is probably not required.

Moreover, if you are the organizer of the meeting:

- **Establish an agenda and objectives.** Ensure that the agenda and the objectives of the meeting 
  are clear and everyone is familiar with them. If you are unable to set the agenda or the 
  objectives, ask yourself if a meeting is needed and if it would be productive.
- **Choose the participants carefully.** Do not invite people who cannot contribute or benefit from
  the meeting. Everyone's time is precious and must be used wisely.
- **Create a shared document.** Create a Google document where all participants can take notes. If
  you are organizing a recurrent meeting, create a separate section for each meeting.

## Before the meeting

- **Be on time.** Nobody likes wasting time. Ensure that you have 5-10 minutes before each meeting
  to get organized. When the time comes, just enter the meeting without waiting for someone to nudge
  you.
- **Come prepared.** Since each meeting must have an agenda and objectives, it should be easy to use
  the ten minutes of preparation time to think what you want to say. This practice helps you 
  structure your thoughts and saves all participants' time.

Additionally, if you are the organizer:

- **Send the agenda.** Review the agenda one more time, make sure every point on it has a title and
  a description that covers what the point is about and how to reach a conclusion, and share the
  agenda with everyone so they have time to read it.

## During the meeting

- **Use a headset.** There is nothing worse than speaking without anyone understanding what you are 
  saying. Get a good headset and use it for the meetings. DO NOT use a laptop microphone: even if it
  seems to work well, in reality it does not.
- **Start your camera (if needed).** If others have their camera on, use yours too. Non-verbal
  communication is important and seeing the face of the person you are talking to helps build trust.
- **Take notes.** Taking notes at a meeting is an excellent way to stay focused and allows those who
  did not participate to know what was said and decided. If you cannot take notes, make sure that
  someone is.
- **Don't veer off topic.** It might be tempting to propose an unrelated idea right when it comes to
  you, but be respectful of everyone's time and make sure any unrelated points are added to the
  bottom of the current meeting's agenda or to another meeting's agenda.

Additionally, if you are the organizer:

- **Run the conversation.** The meeting should run linearly, from one point to the next one. If new
  ideas for discussion arise, add them to the agenda and keep talking about the matter at hand.
- **Moderate off-topic discussion.** When you sense that the meeting is going off-topic, it's your
  responsibility to remind everyone what the current point on the agenda is, and it's in everyone's
  interest that the meeting stays on track and all the points are addressed in the allotted time.

## After the meeting

- **Think about the meeting.** Take five minutes to reorganize the notes and reflect on what has
  been discussed. If you have anything to add, send a message to the participants.

In addition, if you are the organizer:

- **Record the actionable elements.** Write down all actionable elements that emerged during the
  discussion and who is in charge of each initiative, so that participants know what they are
  expected to do. (This also applies to initiatives for which you are responsible.) 
- **Share a summary.** Share the summary from the meeting with other participants, so that 
  everyone can complete their notes.

Additionally, if you are the organizer and the meeting is recurring:

- **Work on the agenda of the next meeting.** At this point you likely have a good idea of subjects
  to discuss and share at the next meeting. This is a good time to write them down.
