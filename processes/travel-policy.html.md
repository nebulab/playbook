# Travel policy

This travel policy defines travel and conference attendance guidelines for 2019. You can find
a [Traveler profile](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aW0GJGBOhCsYzHR2vgt-d5yh0bN5-cqg/) here -
this should be filled out by every team member in order to guarantee a hassle-free trip.

## Communication

The #travel Slack channel should be used for all travel-related requests such as hotel bookings, 
flight tickets and so on. 

## Travel

### Trains

We'll reserve first-class seats at the time preferred by the team member, if possible. There might
be fluctuations of 1 hour from the schedued time.

### Flights

Flight seat categories are the following:

- Italy/Europe: Economy
- Worldwide: Economy with comfort seat (when possible, for flights over 6 hours)

Considering the frequency of our trips abroad, we advise obtaining a passport as soon as you enter
the company, as release times can vary wildly depending on the time of the year.

Make sure to check-in online 24-48 hours in advance and print your boarding pass before departure.

### Car

We prefer to travel by public transport, but if you have to travel by car, the following policies 
apply:

- if you use your vehicle between main offices (Pescara/Latina - Latina/Pescara) there's a flat-rate
reimbursement of €150.00 per round-trip;
- if you use your car in Italy, we'll refer to the ViaMichelin cost estimation;
- total reimbursement for group B rental cars, including fuel and highway fees.

### Uber

Use Uber if you need a quick, easy ride around the city.

Before your departure, check if Uber is available at your destination (you can do it from
[here](https://www.uber.com/it/cities/)). Also make sure you're part of the Nebulab Uber
organization (if you're not, ask for it in the #travel Slack channel).

All you have to do if you need a ride is book your Uber as usual and select "Nebulab Srls" from the
account selection menu.

## Accommodation

Where possible, we'll prefer rooms with two single beds or two queen beds.

| City size    | Country   | Budget (per night per room) | Examples                                      |

| Large        | Italy     | 120€                        | Rome, Milan, Florence, Bologna, Turin         |

| Large        | Worldwide | 200€                        | New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Toronto |

## Reimbursements

To obtain a reimbursement, every team member has to submit a complete travel expense report,
attaching every expense receipt (for both meals and travel) within seven days of their return
date from the trip.

## Conferences

### Conference budget

Every year, we publish a budget detailing the budget allowance and number of days you can use for
conference conference. The conference list contains the number of days and cost for each event.

For 2019, you can use up to **8 working days** and **€3.400,00** for conferences. If you are working
part-time, your budget is reduced proportionally so, e.g. if you're in a 50% part-time contract, you
can use up to €1.700,00.

There are two cases where conference attendance doesn't count towards your budget:

- If you're in the conference marketing team, we won't deduct the conference from your yearly 
  budget.
- If you're invited as a speaker, we won't deduct the conference from your yearly budget.

### Choosing conferences

[This document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QX6YhV3GMPwE9sQ8x52wDhUzyhKRfXxG2jqAFrt3tsQ)
contains a list of interesting conferences:

- self-improvement conferences recommended for topics that are related to our work and business;
- marketing conferences, which are attractive for our marketing initiatives.

These are just suggestions: you can ask us to add other conferences to the document by pinging the
\#conferenze Slack channel.

Your mentor will help you choose which conferences to attend. Propose your conference schedule,
in accordance with our [yearly allowance](#yearly-budget-and-days-amount), and explain why you are
interested in those events.

Finally, make sure to [get the most out of your conferences.](https://github.com/nebulab/playbook/blob/master/personal-growth/conferences.md)

Please note that a three-month notice is required to attend non-European conferences/events, and a
two-month notice is required to attend European/Italian conferences/events.

## Team retreats

We will organize one team retreat per year. Team retreats usually last one week and give us a chance
to get to know each other better, build trust and improve communication and cooperation.

They're also a lot of fun!

We'll inform everyone of team retreats at least three months in advance. Attendance is not 
mandatory, but strongly encouraged.

## Useful apps

- **Wi-Fi Finder** detects free Wi-fi networks.
- **MetrO, Kinevia** is a free mobile guide to public transport systems worldwide. It provides the
fastest route to your point of interest considering the day of the week and the time of the day.
- **the official app of your airline** will often allow you to download an e-ticket for Apple 
Wallet or Pass2U Wallet. Also, it will provide handy information about your flight.
- **MyTaxi** is a taxi app available in 9 European countries (including Italy).
- **[Uber](#uber)**.

## Travel tips

- Always watch your passport's expiration date. Make sure it expires in at least 6 months.
- Also ensure you always have at least two blank pages for visas in your passport.  
- If you are travelling to the US or plan on renting a car/staying at a hotel, you will need a 
  credit card. If you don't have one, get one from your bank or from 
  [American Express](https://www.americanexpress.com/it/).
- You can find useful information for the country you are visiting, such as any practices needed to
  enter the country (visa, vaccinations etc), on the [Farnesina](http://www.viaggiaresicuri.it/home.html)
  website.
