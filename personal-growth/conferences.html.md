## Getting the most out of a conference

It is important to make a distinction between a conference and a team retreat: the conference is an
event focused on learning, while the team retreat is an event focused on having fun and socializing.
While people obviously also socialize at conferences, it is important that your goal in attending a
conference is your own professional growth.

In order to get the most out of a conference, we follow a few basic rules:

- If compatible with client requirements, we try to arrive the day before the conference, so we can
  prepare well in advance, and return only when the conference has finished. If this means staying
  one more night, that's fine.
- We do not stay out too late. Being out until 3 AM can be fun, but it won't be nearly as fun when
  the alarm rings at 7am.
- At the conference, we follow all the talks we want to follow and try not to get distracted.
  Sometimes, we don't like the talk and prefer to leave early, but if this happens repeatedly,
  perhaps we did a poor job of evaluating the conference when we decided to take part.
- We always show the utmost respect towards the speakers. It takes a lot of courage to in front of
  an audience and your ideas.

## After the conference

After the conference, it is a good practice to share what we saw/heard with others, along with
our impressions. It would also be fantastic to write an article about the conference! Here are some
points we could address:

- Was the conference worth it? If yes/no, then why?
- What were the most interesting talks?
- Have we learned things that could be applied to our work?

This information is priceless, because it could help others grow and decide whether to attend the
next conference!
