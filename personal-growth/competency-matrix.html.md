  Nebulab has a structured growth framework to ensure our team members always know what the next
  step is for their career. Read about this process in our Playbook!

In 2018, Nebulab doubled in size, growing from 10 to 20 engineers. This created a unique set of
challenges around our hiring and team retention processes:

- We wanted to have a clear career path for every team member, to help them understand what skills
  they needed to develop in order to improve their craft. This would make it easier for mentors to
  design a growth path for their mentees that is aligned with Nebulab's culture.
- We wanted to have a standardized framework for salaries, to limit the room for negotiation and
  eliminate unconscious bias during the hiring process.
- We wanted to create a promotion process that would involve more than a single manager's opinion.
- We wanted to have a practical way to promote Nebulab's values and culture and reward their
  application in the team's day-to-day work.

We found that the best tool to accomplish this is a competency matrix, a spreadsheet that maps each
role and seniority level in the company to a set of required traits and attitudes.

After looking at a few examples, we designed our own matrix, which you can find here:
[Nebulab Competency Matrix][ncm].

Today, the matrix permeates all aspects of Nebulab, and we use it as a tool to promote our culture
and measure a team member's impact. The matrix will be used by your mentor continuously to help you
grow and evaluate you, so it's paramount you understand how it works!

## How the matrix is structured

The competency matrix is organized by disciplines. Currently, we have the following disciplines, 
but more may be added in the future:

- **Software Engineer:** this is our bread and butter. The majority of our team members are hands-on
  software engineers, tasked with solving a client's problems through the code they write.
- **Team Lead:** a team lead is a software engineer who has chosen to take a managerial path. They
  communicate with clients to understand their priorities and coordinate their team accordingly.
- **Web Marketer:** as the name suggests, this role specializes in marketing. We don't do any
  client-facing marketing work anymore; this is work done for our company or projects we sponsor.
- **Product Designer:** product designers deal with all UX and creative work at Nebulab, both for
  clients and internal projects such as the Nebulab brand, our website and so on.
- **Operations:** these are the people who keep things running smoothly and handle all the
  bureaucracy and processes for us. They're like office managers on steroids!
- **Director:** directors set Nebulab's high-level goals and strategy, define company policies and
  find new business opportunities. They also mentor all other team members.

Each discipline is split by levels and areas, with each area having many skills. Areas are
currently the same for all disciplines:

- **Work:** technical skills that are required for the employee to work in that discipline.
- **Drive:** skills that relate to the employee’s ambition and desire for growth.
- **Fit:** skills that relate to the employee’s relationship with Nebulab and their teammates.

Levels are comparable across disciplines. In other words, an L3 Software Engineer and an L3 Product
Designer have comparable responsibilities and impact in the company.

Each level provides a description of the abilities and traits exhibited by an employee at that
level, as well as practical examples to help managers in the evaluation process.

Furthermore, each level comprises previous levels, so an employee at level 3 also possesses all the 
requirements of levels 1 and 2.

## Using the matrix to grow

As we mentioned, the matrix will be used by your mentor to monitor your progress and figure out what
areas you need to work on to increase your impact at Nebulab. Your mentor will commit to evaluating
you at least once a year, but you may ask for a re-evaluation at any time (within reason) if you
feel like you've been making progress in one or more skills.

Each evaluation will be shared and discussed with you, so that you can share your feedback on the
evaluation and your mentor can provide advice on how to best grow in a particular skill. It is your
mentor job to provide you with the tools and opportunities to continuously improve yourself, so
don't be afraid to ask if you think they can help you in any way!

### Promotions and 360 reviews

Our promotions are descriptive, not prescriptive: in order to be promoted, you need to consistently
exhibit all skills and traits from the higher level for a significant period of time. This is to
prevent people from [rising to the level of their incompetence][peter-principle].

When your mentor evaluates you and realizes you're now at the next level, they will begin the
promotion process. They will conduct a 360 review comprised of:

- Their matrix evaluation
- A short comment on why they think you deserve a promotion
- Feedback from your direct manager (if applicable)
- Feedback from two peers, two direct reports, or a peer and a direct report

So, for instance, if you are a Software Engineer, the promotion package will contain feedback from
your team lead, and two other software engineers. If you are a Team Lead, the feedback will come
from your mentor, another team lead and one of your software engineers.

The goal of the 360 review is to gather feedback from as many different sources as possible, so that
all voices are represented.

This promotion package will then be submitted to the other mentors, who will vote on the promotion
by majority. The mentors' decision is final, although your mentor can present a new promotion
package for evaluation if they think some information was missed in the initial discussion.

### Switching disciplines

Certain disciplines provide you with the ability to switch roles. The only case right now is for
Software Engineers, who can switch to a management career track and become Team Leads once they
reach L3. It is important to note that this is not a promotion, but a step sideways.

If you're interested in switching disciplines, you can do it by talking to your mentor, who will
evaluate you and decide if you're already a good fit for the new discipline or if you need to align
with the new requirements first.

Once you're ready to take on your new role, you will officially be switched over. Your compensation
and any other aspects related to your discipline will be adjusted accordingly.

## The matrix and compensation

Your discipline/level and your compensation are different but related concepts. Each discipline and
level are assigned a compensation package, and these packages are then reused across different
disciplines. This is very powerful in reducing bias when discussing salary and promotions.

We don't feel ready to share our compensation packages publicly yet, although they are readily
available for employees to consult, so it's easy to understand how their discipline and level
compare to others and where they fit in the company.
