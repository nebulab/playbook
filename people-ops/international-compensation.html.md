We hire people in different regions and countries. Every market is different, and it can be
challenging to be competitive and fair towards other team members in making an offer for the same
role but in a different region. The best way to deal with that is by introducing a Location factor.

### Why we pay local salaries

The key argumentations on why we value this policy as a critical success factor, both in hiring
talented people and being fair and profitable as a company, are:

- having a strict salary structure will bring low competitiveness in high salary regions – this
mainly means that we can't hire people in that area;
- having a strict salary structure will bring high competitiveness in low salary regions – this will
bring a geographical concentration of team members, instead of a distributed team which represents
our main goal. Besides, people who are unhappy with their job are less likely to leave if their
compensation is higher than the average market one;
- it's fair for anyone having the same wage for the same role, as far as discretional – team members
are treated equally by the company, which brings a sense of fairness to the team.

## The Location factor

The Location factor is a multiplier of our former salary matrix.

An important note is that we determine factors by using each country's labor index cost instead of
the cost of living. The difference between them is thin but still relevant:

- cost of labor is the cost to hire and retain local nationals;
- cost of living is the cost to maintain a certain standard of living within a geographic location.

It goes without saying that the latter can be far higher than the first one; in some cases, it will
result in paying someone far more than what he's going to obtain from his local market just because
he lives in an expensive area.

To determine the Location factor, we select the area the candidate lives in first, using a couple of
convenient rules.  

### International hires

For candidates who live outside of Italy, if they live within a commutable one hour and thirty
minutes (1:30) of a city listed, we may use that as their location.

### Italian hires

Because of the peculiar characteristic of the territory, for candidates who live in Italy, if they
live within a commutable twenty minutes (0:20) of an Italian city listed, we may use that as their
location.

### Get the indexed salary

Once we get the area the candidate lives in, the math is easy as pie:

```
(Average Italian salary for that role)/(Italy's Location factor)*(Candidate's Location factor)
```

We don't feel ready to share our compensation packages publicly yet, although they are readily
available for employees to consult.

## Relocation

What if someone relocates (for the long-term) outside their current area? We use the Location Factor
for the [Offer step](https://playbook.nebulab.it/people-ops/hiring/#offer) only to define the
candidate's level.

If someone relocates, it is at the company's discretion whether or not to offer a new contract in
the new location.
