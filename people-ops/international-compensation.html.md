We hire people in different regions and countries. Every market is different,
and it can be challenging to be competitive and fair towards other team members
in making an offer for the same role but in a different region. The best way to
deal with that is by introducing a Location factor.
Most of the work here is inspired by or taken verbatim from [Gitlab's approach to international compensation](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/#paying-local-rates),
in particular:

- why it's crucial [paying local rates](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/#why-we-pay-local-rates);
- using [the market-based approach](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/#market-based-approach);
- the [Location factor](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/compensation-calculator/#location-factor)
definition.

We recommend reading them for any further reference.

## The Location factor
To determine the Location factor, we select the area the candidate lives in
first. To do that, we're going to use [Gitlab's approach](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/compensation-calculator/#geographical-areas).

### International hires
For candidates who live outside of Italy, if they live within a commutable one
hour and forty-five minutes (1:45) of a city listed, we may use that as their
location.

### Italian hires
For candidates who live in Italy, if they live within a commutable twenty
minutes (0:20) of an Italian city listed, we may use that as their location.

### Get the indexed salary
Once we get the area the candidate lives in, the math is easy as pie:

```
(Average Italian salary for that role)/("Italy, Everywhere else" Location factor)*(Candidate's Location factor)
```

We don't feel ready to share our compensation packages publicly yet, although
they are readily available for employees to consult.

## Relocation
What if someone relocates (for the long-term) outside their current area? We use
the Location Factor for the [Offer step](https://playbook.nebulab.it/people-ops/hiring/#offer)
only in order to define the candidate's level.

If someone relocates, it is at the company's discretion whether or not to offer
a new contract in the new location.
