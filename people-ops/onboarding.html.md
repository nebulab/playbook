Congratulations on joining Nebulab! We're glad to have you aboard, and we can't wait to see what
you will accomplish during your time here.

We know that joining a company such as Nebulab can be a little overwhelming: there's a lot of new
faces to memorize, a lot of projects to explore and a lot of policies to learn. This is why we have
developed an onboarding process that will help you get comfortable with how we do things around
here.

## Choose your gear

The first thing you want to do is choose your hardware. We not only provide our employees with a
MacBook Pro, but also a wide range of accessories.

Head over to the [Benefits](/personal-growth/benefits) page and make your choices!

## Set up your tools

Next up, you should set up your company accounts and install all the tools we use:

- Make sure you can sign into your work Google account, and that everything's in order both in
  Gmail and Google Calendar. You'll be using these extensively at Nebulab!
- Use your Google account to sign into [Slack](https://nebulab.slack.com).
- Install [Harvest](https://www.getharvest.com), sign in, and make sure you can see all
  company-level projects and any client projects you've been assigned to.
- Sign into [Dipendenti in Cloud](https://www.dipendentincloud.it/) and maybe download their mobile
  app too, so that you can easily submit expense reports when you're abroad.
- Check that you're part of the [Nebulab GitHub organization](https://github.com/nebulab) and
  update your company in your GitHub profile!

If you need any help, don't be afraid to reach out to the person who handled your onboarding!

## Meet your mentor

You've been assigned a mentor, who will be with you during your entire stay at Nebulab!

Your mentor will help you grow personally and professionally and will be your point of reference for
everything about your relationship with Nebulab. Our mentoring practices are explained more
thoroughly in [Mentoring and 1:1s](/personal-growth/mentoring-and-one-on-ones).

When you join the company, your mentor will reach out to schedule your first 1:1, where you'll get
to know each other and structure your mentorship together.

## Meet your team lead

Most likely, you also already have a team lead, who will be your technical supervisor for all
client work.

Your team lead will reach out to set up a call with the rest of your project's team, so that you
get to know the project and the people you'll be working with.

## Read this playbook

Finally, when you've completed all the steps, we suggest reading the rest of this playbook!

You don't have to do it all in one day, or even in one week: simply take the time you need to go
through the content and fully understand it. If needed, make notes of the aspects that are not clear
and ask for clarification or, better yet, [open a PR](/working-on-nebulab/playbook) to improve
them!
