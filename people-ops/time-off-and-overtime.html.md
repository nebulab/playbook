meta_description: >
  The concept of office hours has a different meaning for a remote team such as Nebulab's. Learn how
  we handle time off and overtime in our distributed agency!
---

The workday for full-time contracts is comprised of 8 hours. You can decide to reduce your
contract's work hours and opt for part-time work.

## Holidays

There are 22 days of vacation per year. There's complete flexibility in using these days. Please try
to be as much communicative as possible according to your responsibilities. 

Vacation days accrued in a year must be used within 24 months: e.g., the remaining days on
31/12/2021 must be used by 31/12/2023.

## Public Holidays

You have 11 days which are reported in the company calendar, based on your country of residence.

### International employees

If a Public Holiday falls on non-working days you can take 1 or  2, according to how many days you
lost, following working days off to make up for them.

You can report this days using the `Make up for Public Holidays` option in the HR software.

### Italian employees

The national contract strictly defines the Italian Holidays, and you have 11 Public Holidays too.

A special mention goes to the Patron Saint holiday ("Santo Patrono"). The day of this holiday
depends on where you work from:

- **Pescara:** October 10th;
- **Latina:** July 6th;
- **remote:** October 10th.

On this day, our offices are **not** closed, and you can decide whether you want to work or not.

Since this is considered work on a holiday, your pay will be +30% the standard pay if you choose
to come to the office or work remotely.

## Time off, special paid leave and overtime

The annual number of hours for time off depends on how long you've been with us.

| Length of service       | Hours/Year |
|-------------------------|------------|
| 0 - 24                  |    32      |
| 25 - 48                 |    60      |
| >48                     |    88      |

Another type of paid leave is when it is granted in special cases. Below is a non-exhaustive list:

- birth;
- marriage;
- death of relatives up to the second level;
- blood donation.

If you think you have the right to paid leave, write to the administrative manager (@endriu), who
will check this for you.

Overtime is a working time in excess of the 8 hours a day. We don't recommend, under any
circumstances, to exceed the limit of 48 hours a week.

### Compensation and rounding-off

All overtime hours and time off in the month will be compensated at the end of the month. The
balance will then be rounded-up to the nearest half-hour by applying the following rules:

- from 0 to 0.249 = 0;
- from 0.25 to 0.749 = 0.5;
- from 0.75 to 1 = 1

and so on.

## Sick leave

We support you in the unfortunate case of sick leave. We pay a different percentage of the daily pay
for sick days, depending on the event number from the year beginning and the number of days.
Rates are shown in this table:

| % Pay | Days 1-3 | Days 4-20 | Days 21+ |
| Event 1 | 100% | 25% | 33% |
| Event 2 | 100% | 25% | 33% |
| Event 3 | 100% | 25% | 33% |
| Event 4 | 100% | 25% | 33% |
| Event 5+ | 0% | 25% | 33% |

The event counter resets when a new year arrives.

### International employees

To grant your sick leave, we need a medical certificate or medical care proof.

We highly recommend covering the earning loss risk with appropriate insurance coverage.

### Italian employees

For communications regarding sick leave, employees must contact their physician to request a sick
leave certificate. The physician will send the certificate electronically to INPS, which, in turn,
will make it available in electronic form. Based on the sick leave days granted by the attending
physician, the employee must communicate to the company the days of absence together with the
certificate's unique code.

## Most used permit types

When deciding which type of permit to choose between, adopt the following rules:

- `Holidays` is used for vacation days: you can use it for whole days off;
- `Sick leave` is used in case of sick leave (make sure to **add the protocol code issued by your
  physician to the notes**);
- `Special paid leave` is used for time off granted in special cases listed in the section
  [Time off, special leave and overtime](#time-off-special-leave-and-overtime).
