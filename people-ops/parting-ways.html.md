  Parting ways is always sad, but it can happen sometimes. Should that be the case, we have a
  process to ensure a smooth offboarding for our team members.

It's always sad when we have to part ways with an employee, whether because they have decided to
pursue other opportunities or because they're not a good fit. When this happens, though, we want to
make sure the offboarding experience is as smooth as possible for everyone involved.

## Resignation

The employment contract provides the worker with the option of withdrawing unilaterally from the
contract by submitting his/her resignation.

### International employees

The contract carries a Term and Termination clause. The term vary depending on contract, it is
usually 60 days, but please check your individual case.

### Italian employees
The [resignation process](https://www.cliclavoro.gov.it/Cittadini/Pagine/Adempimenti.aspx) is remote
and can be sent in various ways:

* Autonomously, on the [cliclavoro.gov.it](http://cliclavoro.gov.it) website for all those who
  have INPS access credentials. Below is a link to a useful
  [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/02yuLr7-h_E).
* By going to authorized entities, such as patronages, trade union organizations, certification
  commissions, bilateral entities, and, with the introduction of Legislative Decree 185/2016, also
  labor consultants and territorial offices at the National Labor Inspectorate ("Ispettorato
  Nazionale del Lavoro").

The resignation must be given with sufficient advance notice, variable depending on contract type as
well as employment length and level. It is usually 20-30 days, but please check your individual
case.

## Termination

Sometimes, we're also forced to let an employee go. This can happen for a number of reasons, but
usually it's the result of a failed [performance plan](/people-ops/performance-plans/) or a critical
lack of alignment between Nebulab and the employee.

If you are being let go, we want you to know how the situation will be handled and what you can
expect from us:

* We will announce the event the morning after the termination, to avoid rumors and unnecessary
  concerns among other team members.
* We will protect your privacy by withholding any sensitive information about the reasons and
  circumstances around your termination.
* We will only discuss our general practices for handling performance problems, to reassure team
  members that there is a fair process in place.

Of course, you're more than welcome to say goodbye and/or discuss any details of your termination
with your colleagues.
