Nebulab was founded by two developers and one designer with a shared desire: to create a company 
that delivers exceptionally high-quality digital products. No compromises allowed.

Today Nebulab is a growing company of digital consulting experts specialized in designing, 
developing, and maintaining high-quality eCommerce websites built with Solidus and Ruby on Rails 
applications.

We strive to produce high-quality work basing our processes and company life on lean principles and 
respect for people we work with: our teammates, the Open Source community, and our clients.

## Teammates

We strongly believe in personal and professional growth, a sustainable pace, and a healthy work-life 
balance. Thatâ€™s the reason we aim at providing the best place to work: a place where learning and 
sharing are possible, and benefits go along with a tailored growth path.

## Open Source

Getting involved in Open Source by learning, coding, and giving back is our way to succeed. This 
endless cycle allows us to improve our skills, find new clients, and inspire others using Open 
Source to do the same.

## Clients

We collaborate with companies that share our mindset and working values such as professionalism, 
transparency, and a sense of mutual respect and cooperation. Our team of trusted, engaged, and 
motivated individuals understands our clients' real needs and drives them to success throughout a 
high level of empathy, autonomy, and technical skills.
