  Did you know that Nebulab, the company, is managed as if it were a Scrum product? If you want to
  experiment with this approach, find out more in our Playbook!

Nebulab, the company, is run by a group of 4 directors who handle all aspects of it: strategy, team
building, sales, marketing, client retention and everything else that is not the day-to-day work of
our team members. With so many aspects to cover and such a small management group, things can
quickly become overwhelming if tasks are not prioritized correctly. 

In July 2019, we completely revamped our approach to running Nebulab. We decided that we wanted to
run the company like a product and adopted Scrum as our methodology. Today, all management work goes
into Scrum sprints to be categorized, prioritized and executed.

## Tools

We use Jira as our task management tool. For estimates, we use the excellent [Planning Poker Jira
add-on](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1212495/planning-poker?hosting=cloud&tab=overview).

We use [Funretro](https://funretro.io/) for [sprint retrospectives](#sprint-retrospective).

## Epics

Our work is split by epics. We don’t use epics in the traditional way, but rather as a means to 
categorize and identify the goal each task is aimed at. In fact, each epic is a business goal for 
Nebulab.

Tasks that don’t fit into any of our epics probably don’t bring us closer to our goals, and should 
be either executed outside of the sprints or dropped entirely.

## Ceremonies

For a more detailed explanation of Scrum ceremonies, you can read the
[Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html).

The rest of this section will cover how we use Scrum at Nebulab specifically.

### Sprint duration

Our standard sprint duration is 4 weeks, Thursday to Thursday.

### Weekly standup

Every Thursday, we have a standup meeting. We meet over a video call and every member of the sprint
answers the following questions:

* What have you done this week?
* What are you going to do next week?
* Any blockers impeding your progress?

That’s it, no discussion or comments allowed. If you want to discuss a member’s standup further, you
can ping them on Slack and chat or schedule a follow-up call.

### Sprint retrospective

On the last day of the sprint, we hold a sprint retrospective, where we discuss how the sprint went,
what challenges we faced and how we can do better for the future.

The retrospective is run by using our own version of the 
[Six Thinking Hats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Thinking_Hats) methodology. The thinking hats
force us to consider different angles of the topic we’re discussing.

At the end of the retrospective, the Scrum master summarizes the next steps and transforms them into
Jira issues, which will then be prioritized along with the rest of the tasks.

### Sprint planning

After the retrospective, we run a sprint planning session.

The Scrum master chooses a name and outlines the goal of the new sprint, then goes through each
issue on the backlog, sorted by priority, and decides - along with the team - which issues should be
part of the sprint.

Once the issues have been chosen, they are weighted in a planning poker session. We use the
Fibonacci scale, up to 13 (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13).

Once the issues have been moved into the sprint and weighted, the Scrum master starts the new sprint
and work begins.

### Backlog grooming

All members are free to add issues to the Jira board if they can be assigned to one of the
epics/business goals.

We don’t have formal backlog grooming sessions: we understand that most of the issues in our Jira
board will most likely never get done because they are not really important, and don’t want to waste
time describing them and/or weighing them unnecessarily.

Instead, issues are only defined and weighed when they are put into a sprint.
