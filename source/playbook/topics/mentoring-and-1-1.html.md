# Mentoring and 1:1s

Upon your arrival at Nebulab, a mentor will be assigned to you. His/her duty is to follow you and
ensure that you are constantly improving. Your mentor is your point of reference for anything
concerning the Nebulab world, so feel free to contact him/her at any time with any queries or
concerns you may have.

One of the most important responsibilities of your mentor is the organization of one-on-one (1:1)
meetings. Each first Friday of the month (if you are an intern, every other Friday), you will have a
one-on-one meeting with your mentor. The 1:1 is not a standard meeting: there is no agenda, nor is
there a set duration. If you wish, you can inform your mentor in advance about what you would like
to discuss, but it is not required. If you do not have anything specific to discuss, it will simply
be a friendly chat.

Here are some things that the one-on-one is NOT:

- It is not necessarily an office meeting.  If you want to take a walk, tell this to your mentor. 
  If you want to have a coffee, that's fine. If you want/have to do this from home, that works too.
- It is not an update on the status of projects you are working on. If there is a particular work
  issue you wish to discuss, feel free to do so, but your mentor will not ask you to do so.
- It is not a meeting where you have to talk about work: if something nice (or not so nice) has
  happened in your life recently and you would like to discuss this at the 1:1, do so: these are the
  most important conversations and your mentor will be there for you. 
- It is not an obligatory meeting: if one day you simply don't feel like talking, please tell your 
  mentor and move the meeting to another date. 1:1s are recurring for organizational purposes but
  they focus on people, not schedules.

At the end of the 1:1, your mentor will take some notes on what you discussed and what you both
commit to, so that at the following meeting you can review them and see how things have progressed.
This document will be shared with you and you are free to make any adjustments or add topics for the
next meeting.

The 1:1 is also a time to discuss your [personal growth projects](https://github.com/nebulab/playbook/blob/master/personal-growth/fridays.md)
and the goals you set for yourself.
