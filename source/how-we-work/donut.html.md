title: Donut
---

Periodically during the week, [Donut](https://donut.com) will pair people in the #coffee channel. It
will kick off the conversation with a fun icebreaker and then encourage you to take a remote coffee
or Donut together.

The Donut can take any form you want, but usually, it's a 10-20 minutes video call where you can talk
about whatever's on your mind — it doesn't have to be work. In fact, most people use it to catch
up about their hobbies, families, and personal lives to get to know colleagues with whom they
usually don't have a lot of interaction. Donut is just like any break and should not be tracked.

If you're a remote worker, Donut is an excellent way to socialize with the rest of the team. If you work
from an office, it's still great to get to know the rest of the team — in this case, you can "ban"
your co-located colleagues so that Donut only pairs you with people you don't know as well.

If you haven't tried Donut yet and would like to participate in the next round of pairings, feel
free to join the #coffee channel on Slack!
