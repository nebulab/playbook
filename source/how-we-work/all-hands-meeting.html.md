title: All-Hands meeting
---

Every month, we hold an All-Hands meeting. We use this session to provide useful information
to all team members to increase transparency on Nebulab's direction, successes, failures, and
next challenges.

The meeting is completely asynchronous - we want everyone to be able to receive the updates
whenever they feel like it or to re-watch important parts of the meeting.

On the day of the meeting a few recorded videos will be made available in the [#all-hands][slack]
channel and everyone is invited to watch them when they get the chance. The videos are recorded
with [Loom](https://www.loom.com/).

The meeting covers several topics:

- **Keynote** A general presentation of the topics for the current All-Hands meeting. This
  mainly serves to understand what topics will be touched in the meeting you're about
  to attend. Often, there is an introduction of new hires to the team, so everyone has
  some information about them. Here we may also talk about people who have left the company
  if that happens.
- **Strategy.** This topic covers the high-level decisions that we are doing to make
  Nebulab grow. We talk about new sales initiatives, our hiring process, or how we
  are setting things up for personal and professional growth of individuals. We share
  such information with everyone both to be aligned and to receive any feedback about
  the direction in which we're going.
- **New projects.** We introduce new clients, talking about their business, their team,
  which team members are assigned to work with them, and why we think the client is a good
  fit for us. If we have lost a client instead, we honestly share what didn't work with them.
- **Policy of the Month.** We are very proud of this Playbook, it's our set of policies and
  every employee can refer to these pages when they have some doubts about how to behave.
  Anyway, it's unrealistic to expect that everyone recalls all the Playbook's content. This
  space reminds us about a single policy we have in the Playbook so we can jog our
  memory about that specific thing. The policy of the month is chosen by the meeting's
  organizers.
- **Playbook changes.** When policies change in our Playbook, there's no better way to
  talk about them with the rest of the team. This allows us to share why things have
  changed and how these differences will impact company life.
- **Project Updates** Engineering managers have the chance to present a short update on the work that
  their team is doing. This is the place to celebrate successes, share knowledge and understand
  what other teams are doing.
