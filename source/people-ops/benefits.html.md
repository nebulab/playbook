All members of the team are entitled to the benefits listed in this document. If you have any doubts
regarding any of the benefits, feel free to ask!

- **[Remote-first culture](/how-we-work/where-when-and-how/#remote-work).**
  We've been a distributed company since 2012. Every process is obsessively designed for effective
  remote work and collaboration.
- **[Flexible work hours](/how-we-work/where-when-and-how).**
  As long as you’re doing great work and enjoying it, we don’t really care if it’s a standard 9-to-5
  or a more exotic schedule. All members of the team have the right to choose their own schedule,
  as long as they're not impacting someone's else productivity.
- **[Mentoring](/personal-growth/mentoring-and-one-on-ones).**
  When you become a member of our team, you will be assigned a mentor, who will support your
  personal and professional growth. If you are interested in a given subject and would
  like to study it, or if a project you are working on is particularly challenging, do not hesitate
  to contact your mentor who will be happy to help you!
- **[Investment Time](/personal-growth/investment-time).**
  You can use up to 10% of your time to focus on studying or to work on side-projects. If you don't
  know what to work on, ask your mentor to help you find a project appropriate for your growth.
- **[Generous PTO](/people-ops/paid-time-off).**
  Up to 33 days of paid time off plus 11 days of national holidays.
- **[Team retreats.](/people-ops/travel-policy/#team-retreats)**
  Each year we organize a team retreat where we work and have fun together. The purpose of these
  meetings is to let members of the team who work in different offices or remotely socialize; your
  are encouraged to take part!
