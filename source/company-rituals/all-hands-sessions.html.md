title: All-hands sessions
---

Every month, we hold an all-hands session.

Unlike at most companies, our all-hands sessions are completely asynchronous: they are recorded with
[Loom](https://www.loom.com/) and shared in our Notion workspace, as well as in a dedicated Slack
channel.  We want the team to be able to consume them when they have time and at their own pace,
rather than having to wake up at 5am to watch what is, essentially, a two-hour conference.
If you have any questions, you can ask them on Slack, on the Loom recording or in your next 1:1.

All-hands don't have a fixed agenda, but you can expect most of the content to be presented by the
Managing Partners and Directors. We try to cover a variety of cross-cutting topics such as recent successes and failures
and what we've learned from them, any updates on company strategy, new company policies, any team
members that are joining/leaving the team, any new partners and why we think they're a good fit, and
anything else that we think might be of interest.

Every once in a while, we also have team members present cool client-facing or internal projects
they've worked on. Rather than having strictly top-down all-hands, we try to turn them into a ritual
for the entire company to gather and talk about interesting stuff.

If you have a suggestion for a topic you want to see at the next all-hands or want to be a speaker,
reach out to your manager!
