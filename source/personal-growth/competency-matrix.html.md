title: Competency matrix
---

In 2018, Nebulab doubled in size, growing from 10 to 20 engineers. This created a unique set of
challenges around our hiring and team retention processes:

- We wanted to have a clear career path for every team member, to help them understand what skills
  they needed to develop in order to improve their craft. This would make it easier for managers to
  design a growth path for their mentees that is aligned with Nebulab's culture.
- We wanted to have a standardized framework for salaries, to limit the room for negotiation and
  eliminate unconscious bias during the hiring process.
- We wanted to create a promotion process that would involve more than a single manager's opinion.
- We wanted to have a practical way to promote Nebulab's values and culture and reward their
  application in the team's day-to-day work.

We found that the best tool to accomplish this is a competency matrix, a spreadsheet that maps each
role and seniority level in the company to a set of required traits and attitudes.

After looking at a few examples, we designed our own matrix, which you can find here:
[Nebulab Competency Matrix][ncm].

Today, the matrix permeates all aspects of Nebulab, and we use it as a tool to promote our culture
and measure a team member's impact. The matrix will be used by your manager continuously to help you
grow and evaluate you, so it's paramount you understand how it works!

Be aware that [Progression][progression], the tool that we're using for the matrix, refers to the
competency matrix as "Framework" so there isn't a real difference between the two and using either term
is fine.

## How the matrix is structured

The competency matrix is organized by disciplines. Currently, we have the following disciplines,
but more may be added in the future:

- **Software Engineer:** this is our bread and butter. The majority of our team members are hands-on
  software engineers, tasked with solving a client's problems through the code they write.
- **Engineering Manager:** an engineering manager (or team lead) is a contributor who has chosen to
  take a managerial path. They communicate with clients to understand their priorities and
  coordinate their team accordingly.
- **Product Designer:** product designers deal with all UX and creative work at Nebulab, both for
  clients and internal projects such as the Nebulab brand, our website and so on.
- **Operations Manager:** these are the people who keep things running smoothly and handle all the
  bureaucracy and processes for us. They're like office managers on steroids!

Each discipline is split by levels and areas, with each area having many skills. Areas are
currently the same for all disciplines:

- **Craft:** technical skills that are required for the employee to work in that discipline.
- **Human:** skills that relate to the employee’s ambition and desire for growth.
- **Leadership:** skills that relate to the employee’s relationship with Nebulab and their teammates.

Levels are comparable across disciplines. In other words, an SE3 Software Engineer and an PD3 Product
Designer have comparable responsibilities and impact in the company.

Each level provides a description of the abilities and traits exhibited by an employee at that
level, as well as practical examples to help managers in the evaluation process.

Furthermore, each level comprises previous levels, so an employee at level 3 also possesses all the
requirements of levels 1 and 2. It's also interesting to note that certain skills do not go further
as the levels progress, so once that skill is learnt no further work is required there.

## Using the matrix to grow

As we mentioned, the matrix will be used by your manager to monitor your progress and figure out what
areas you need to work on to increase your impact at Nebulab. We use [Progression][progression], for
evaluating team members, and the process is the following:

1. You will log into Progression with Nebulab's Google account and start a check-in.
2. For each skill in the matrix, you will need to select whether you are *working towards* the
   expectations, *meeting* the expectations or *exceeding* the expectations for that level. Although
   it is not required, you're strongly encouraged to also provide examples of situations where you
   performed at that level.
3. Once you've completed your side of the check-in, your manager will be notified and will follow
   the same exact steps.
4. When your manager has also completed the check-in, you will both be notified and should schedule
   a meeting to finalize the evaluation.
5. To finalize the evaluation, you will look at both your check-in and your manager's and reconcile
   any differences.

The result of the evaluation will tell you whether you're *working towards*, *meeting* or
*exceeding* the overall expectations for your position at Nebulab:

- If you are working towards the expectations, your manager will work with you to get up to speed.
- If you are meeting expectations, your manager will work with you to determine which area to grow
  in next.
- If you are exceeding the expectations, good job! Continue working with your manager to grow.

Note that, while most check-ins will be requested against your _current_ position at Nebulab, you
are also welcome to request check-ins against the next level of your career path, or even an
entirely separate position (e.g., you're a Software Engineer and want to check in against
Engineering Manager). This is extremely useful if you want to get a sense of how you would perform
in another position at the company, and is the basis for all career path transitions.

As a general rule, all team members are required to check in against their current position _at
least_ once a year.

### Promotion process

Our promotions are descriptive, not prescriptive: in order to be promoted, you need to consistently
exhibit all skills and traits from the higher level for a significant period of time. This is to
prevent people from [rising to the level of their incompetence][peter-principle].

When you check in with your manager and the conclusion is that you're meeting your next level in the
competency matrix, your manager will begin the  promotion process. They will assemble a promotion
package comprised of your latest matrix evaluation and a comment explaining why they think you
should be promoted.

This promotion package will then be submitted to the directors group, who will vote on the promotion
by majority. The group's decision is final, although your manager can present a new promotion package
for evaluation if they think some information was missed in the initial discussion.

#### Mid-level promotions

If you're on the path to your next matrix position, you may be eligible for a mid-level salary bump.
This happens when you are evaluated as **Meeting** on at least half the number of new skill
requirements for the next position.

Note that, since the level required for each skill doesn't always change from one position to the
next, only the skills with new requirements are considered in this calculation.

### Switching disciplines

Certain disciplines provide you with the ability to switch roles. For instance, if you are an SE3
Software Engineer, you may decide to take the managerial path and become an EM3 Engineering Manager.
It is important to note that this is not a promotion, but a step sideways.

If you're interested in switching disciplines, you can do it by talking to your manager, who will
ask you to request a check in against the new discipline. This will help you understand whether
you already have all the skills you would need, or if you need to work towards meeting some of the
expectations for your new role.

Once you're ready to take on your new role, you will officially be switched over. Your compensation
and any other aspects related to your discipline will be adjusted accordingly.

## The matrix and compensation

Your discipline/level and your compensation are different but related concepts. Each discipline and
level are assigned a compensation package, and these packages are then reused across different
disciplines. This is very powerful in reducing bias when discussing salary and promotions.

We don't feel ready to share our compensation packages publicly yet, although they are readily
available for employees to consult, so it's easy to understand how their discipline and level
compare to others and where they fit in the company.
